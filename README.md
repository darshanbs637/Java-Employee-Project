## 🎯 Objective

Build a **menu-driven console application** that can:

- Add employees
- View employees
- Update employee details
- Delete employees
- Process salary
- Save & load data from file

---

## ⚙️ Features (Simplified)

### ✅ FR-01: Add Employee
- Fields:
  - ID
  - Name
  - Salary
  - Type (Permanent / Contract)

✔ Concepts:
- Classes & Objects
- Encapsulation
- Constructors

---

### ✅ FR-02: View All Employees

✔ Concepts:
- Collections (`ArrayList`)
- Loops

---

### ✅ FR-03: Update Employee

✔ Concepts:
- Object manipulation
- Condition checking

---

### ✅ FR-04: Delete Employee

✔ Concepts:
- Collection removal

---

### ✅ FR-05: Employee Types (Polymorphism)

- Permanent → Bonus applicable  
- Contract → No bonus  

✔ Concepts:
- Inheritance
- Method overriding

---

### ✅ FR-06: Salary Calculation

Simple logic:

- Permanent:
  - Bonus = 10%
- Contract:
  - No bonus

✔ Concepts:
- Polymorphism
- Method overriding

---

### ✅ FR-07: Search Employee

Search by:
- ID
- Name

✔ Concepts:
- Streams (basic filter)
OR
- Loop-based search

---

### ✅ FR-08: Exception Handling

- If employee not found → throw custom exception

✔ Concepts:
- Custom Exception
- try-catch

---

### ✅ FR-09: File Save & Load

- Save employees to file (`employees.txt`)
- Load on startup

✔ Concepts:
- File I/O
- BufferedReader / BufferedWriter

---

### ✅ FR-10: Multithreading (Basic)

- Process salary for all employees using threads

✔ Concepts:
- Runnable / ExecutorService
